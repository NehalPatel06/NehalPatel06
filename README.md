Hello! My name is Nehal Patel and welcome to my GitHub page! A few facts about me are that I am a graduate of the Business Technology Management program from Toronto Metropolitan University. I am also a huge technology enthusiast and my interest largely lies in learning and absorbing new technologies in order to contribute meaningfully to creating positive change! I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and have extensive experience with both fields. This is reflected throughout my coursework and extracurriculars which range from training machine learning models to monitoring cyber spaces and staying on top of current cybersecurity trends. You can see my resume here: linkedin.com/in/nehal-patel-b85b24208. Feel free to reach out to me for networking, exchanges, and collaborations. I'm open to new ideas and fun projects!
